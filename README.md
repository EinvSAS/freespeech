Free Speech is an augmentative and alternative communication web application designed to help the non-verbal communicate without cost.

* **Free & Open-Source, Forever:** Free Speech is committed to providing its services at no cost for the entire duration of the application's lifespan. We believe that communication is a right that everyone deserves to have access too regaurdless of income status.
* **Hosted on the Internet:** Free Speech is completely hosted from your web browser, meaning it will run on about anything with an internet connection. Our team reccommends tablets, touch screen laptops, and computers to run the software, however smart-phones can be used too.
* **Fully Customizable:** Free Speech's edit mode makes it easy for just about anyone to start programming AAC tile layouts. The app is designed to support both extensive large-scale custom tile layouts as well as small and quick edits on the fly. You can also export and import tile layouts from a file, meaning they're sharable across devices. Your customizations save automatically in the browser, so there's no need to worry about lost progress.
